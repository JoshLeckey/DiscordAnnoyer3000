# DiscordAnnoyer3000
This bot targets a specific user and if that user says a banned word it deletes their message and the post then says one of the "good sentences"
good way to annoy someone if you make the bot look like their profile so it looks like they are saying something weird.

#Requirements
\nInstall discord.js
\nInsall Node.js

#How to set up
goto https://discord.com/developers/applications and create a new application
under the appliation create a new bot
copy the token of the bot and place it in the .env file
add the bot to the discord server via this link (replace the userid with the userid of your bot)
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id={botuserid}&scope=bot&permissions=8

#Another section
the bot always appears invisible so it can hide in the user list.
